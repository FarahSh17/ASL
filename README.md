# ASL


# Repository Overview :




#### Welcome to the ASL Repository! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of resources and tools for working with American Sign Language. The goal is to bridge the communication gap between the deaf community and the general population by facilitating the understanding and learning of ASL.

#

# Features :
#### ASL Alphabet Recognition: This repository includes a pre-trained deep learning model capable of recognizing individual ASL alphabet signs. The model takes an input image or video frame and predicts the corresponding letter from the ASL alphabet.


#### ASL Gesture Translation: In addition to alphabet recognition, this repository also offers a gesture translation feature. Users can record ASL gestures or upload gesture videos, and the repository will provide translations into written English.
